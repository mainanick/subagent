# All Alone, a serverless outbound email server(message submission agent (MSA)) [WIP]

[All Alone](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Alone_(pigeon)>) **(NURP.39.SDS.39) was a war pigeon who was decorated for bravery in service during the Second World War for delivering an important secret message in one day over a distance of 400 miles (640 km), while serving with the National Pigeon Service in August, 1943.**

## Challenges

SMTP server are 'stateful', its advisable serverless functions(lambda, GCP Functions) to be stateless

```
Keeping functions stateless enables AWS Lambda to rapidly launch as many copies of the function as needed to scale to the rate of incoming events. While AWS Lambdaâ€™s programming model is stateless, your code can access stateful data by calling other web services, such as Amazon S3 or Amazon DynamoDB.
```

## API

Attempt to send 1,000,000 Emails free of charge using lambda.

```ts
import allalone from "allalone/lambda";
export.default = allalone("<config object>") // Returns an aws lambda handler function
```

Rest API

```sh
curl -s --user 'api:YOUR_API_KEY' \
    https://<YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME>/mail \
    -F from='Excited User <user@YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME>' \
    -F to=bar@example.com \
    -F subject='Hello' \
    -F text='All Alone!'
```

SMTP

```ts
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  host: "smtp.<yourhostname>.com",
  port: 587,
  auth: {
    user: "user",
    pass: "pass"
  }
});

await transporter.sendMail({
  from: '"Fred Foo ðŸ‘»" <foo@example.com>', // sender address
  to: "bar@example.com, baz@example.com", // list of receivers
  subject: "Hello âœ”", // Subject line
  text: "Hello world?", // plain text body
  html: "<b>Hello world?</b>" // html body
});
```
